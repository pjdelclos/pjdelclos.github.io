  My main interests lie in determining the genetic and environmental mechanisms by which behaviors are developed, with a particular interest in the development of social and mating dynamics both within and among species.
  To address these behavioral questions, my research applies a multidisciplinary approach, drawing on principles and methodologies ranging from chemical and thermal ecology to genetics, and I ultimately couple these skills to address questions related to <em>how</em> animals develop certain traits and behaviors and <em>why</em> we see animals behave in different ways. 
  To answer these questions at UH-Downtown, I use the house fly system. To learn more specifics, check out our <a href=" https://pjdelclos.github.io/about/" title=" https://pjdelclos.github.io/about/"> research</a> section. To see more stuff I've done, here's my <a href="https://pjdelclos.github.io/Delclos_CV.pdf" target="https://pjdelclos.github.io/Delclos_CV.pdf">CV.</a>

  Hafsa is currently analyzing cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) data collected from various strains of house fly. She is specifically focused on identifying candidate CHC compounds that are differentially expressed between III<sup>M</sup> and Y<sup>M</sup> male house flies.

  Saima is currently analyzing CHC data collected from various strains of house fly. Her research mostly focuses on identifying sex-specific CHCs whose expression patterns are sensitive to developmental temperature.
