# Hello There!

I'm Professor Delclos, and this is my sidekick Carlos. I am a biologist that focuses on animal behavior and genetics. I got my BS in Ecology & Evolutionary Biology at Rice University, where I studied the predatory behaviors of little aquatic damselfly larvae in the standstill ponds of East Texas. From there, I got my PhD in Biology at Texas A&M University. For this research I studied the genetics of mating behaviors in these two species of hybridizing swordtail fish that are found in the mountains of Hidalgo, Mexico (I still dablle in fishes here and there). After that, I started studying all sorts of insects until I joined UH-D, where I'll be studying the behavior of house flies.

# The Personal Stuff
I'm married with an ever-growing number of pets: I have a cat, Wybie (a reference to Coraline), a dog, Jubilee (a reference to X-Men), a human son, Carlos Xavier (...X-Men), and a human daughter, Juliana Elena (Man in the High Castle / Vampire Diaries... not my choice...). I love cooking, many things from the nerd world (Star Wars, X-Men, The Walking Dead comics). To those who are up-to-date with D&D, I am a level 13 dwarf artificer, and I like to make little miniatures and tiny furniture for D&D. What else? I'm Spanish-American and spent a lot of time back and forth between Spain and Houston. I grew up loving FC Barcelona, but have since grown more interested in worse soccer teams like Gimnastic de Tarragona.

I, personally, would like to welcome you to BIOL 1102 General Biology II Lab! Labs like these are what started to draw me towards my love for and career in biology, and I'm hoping to spark that same interest for some of you. I am excited to share my knowledge with you as you engage with course materials, other students, and with me through the course of the semester. Keep in mind that if you ever feel lost, or need extra help, I am here for you via e-mail or video conferencing. You simply have to ask. I'm looking forward to getting to know each and every one of you!
