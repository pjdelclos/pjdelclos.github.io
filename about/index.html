<h1> The House Fly <em>Musca domestica</em> </h1>

Evolutionary transitions in the sex determination pathway are often accompanied by rapid turnover of the sex chromosomes, which can explain why sex chromosomes are often very different across even closely related species.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Because of this, a major goal in evolutionary biology is to identify the factors that drive the evolution of sex determination pathways as well as identifying what the consequences of developing new sex chromosomes are.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
So house flies are pretty unique in this aspect because they exhibit what’s called polygenic sex determination, where the primary male-determining gene can be found on ANY of the six chromosomes that house flies have.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Now, while this gene <em>can</em> be found on almost any chromosome, in nature we find it most frequently on what was originally the ancestral Y chromosome (Y<sup>M</sup> genotype) or on the autosomal 3rd (III<sup>M</sup>).
<p>&nbsp;</p>

In nature, we find that these new Y chromosomes, III<sup>M</sup> and Y<sup>M</sup>, have been maintained as a stable polymorphism for <em>at least</em> over a century, which theory suggests shouldn’t happen.  Theory suggests that one of these <em>should</em> win out eventually, but we see no signs of that happening.
<em>Instead</em> we see that Y<sup>M</sup> and III<sup>M</sup> are distributed along these latitudinal clines across multiple continents, with III<sup>M</sup> most common in the south, warmer climates and Y<sup>M</sup> most common in the north.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Environmental temperature has been shown to be the best predictor of the III<sup>M</sup> and Y<sup>M</sup> frequencies across populations but this hasn’t been empirically tested until recently in our lab, and this effect of temperature on behavior is something that we will continue to investigate!
<p>&nbsp;</p>
So, we see these two different genotypes, males with the traditional Y chromosome, and males with this relatively <em>new</em> Y chromosome on what was once chromosome III. To ask why we see this stable polymorphism, one question we ask is: <em>how</em> do these two male types even differ? Well, keep on reading to see some ways we think they may differ!
