Evolutionary transitions in the sex determination pathway are often accompanied by rapid turnover of the sex chromosomes, which can explain why sex chromosomes are often very different across even closely related species.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Because of this, a major goal in evolutionary biology is to identify the factors that drive the evolution of sex determination pathways as well as identifying what the consequences of developing new sex chromosomes are.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
So house flies are pretty unique in this aspect because they exhibit what’s called polygenic sex determination, where the primary male-determining gene can be found on <em>any</em> of the six chromosomes that house flies have.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Now, while this gene <em>can</em> be found on almost any chromosome, in nature we find it most frequently on what was originally the ancestral Y chromosome (Y<sup>M</sup> genotype) or on the autosomal 3rd (III<sup>M</sup>).
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img style="margin-left: 30px" align="right" src=../images/cline.png height="300" width="180">
In nature, we find that these new Y chromosomes, III<sup>M</sup> and Y<sup>M</sup>, have been maintained as a stable polymorphism for <em>at least</em> over a century, which theory suggests shouldn’t happen.  Theory suggests that one of these <em>should</em> win out eventually, but we see no signs of that happening.
<em>Instead</em> we see that Y<sup>M</sup> and III<sup>M</sup> are distributed along these latitudinal clines across multiple continents, with III<sup>M</sup> most common in the south, warmer climates and Y<sup>M</sup> most common in the north.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Environmental temperature has been shown to be the best predictor of the III<sup>M</sup> and Y<sup>M</sup> frequencies across populations (<a href="http://www.evolutionary-ecology.com/abstracts/v10/2286.html" title="http://www.evolutionary-ecology.com/abstracts/v10/2286.html">Feldmeyer et al. 2008</a>) but this hasn’t been empirically tested until recently in our lab, and this effect of temperature on behavior is something that we will continue to investigate!
<p>&nbsp;</p>
So, we see these two different genotypes, males with the traditional Y chromosome, and males with this relatively <em>new</em> Y chromosome on what was once chromosome III. To ask why we see this stable polymorphism, one question we ask is: <em>how</em> do these two male types even differ? Well, keep on reading to see some ways we think they may differ!
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1> <em>Mechanisms</em> of Chemical Communication</h1>

One way greater minds (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1603/022.038.0225" title="https://doi.org/10.1603/022.038.0225">Hamm et al. 2009</a>) have shown these III<sup>M</sup> and Y<sup>M</sup> males to differ is in their ability to mate: When you pit each male type in an arena and add an unrelated female, the III<sup>M</sup> male usually comes out on type (mates with the female). If you translate this to a mini-population environment (stick some females in a cage with a population of males, half of which are III<sup>M</sup> and the other half that are Y<sup>M</sup>), and over time, the Y<sup>M</sup> males get weeded out, and you're left with a cage full of females and III<sup>M</sup> males.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
A decade later, we followed this line of thought and asked what's going on here. To keep things short, we did a bunch of behavioral trials and genetic analyses, and we found out a couple of things: 1) this III<sup>M</sup> male mating advantage is <em>not</em> sensitive to the temperature these flies are raised at, 2) this mating advantage <em>might</em> be because III<sup>M</sup> males are just faster at trying to mate, and 3) this behavior might be controlled by a cluster of genes that happen to be located on that third chromosome (what's now the III<sup>M</sup> male's <em>sex chromosome</em>). What's more, the genetic mechanism that regulates this behavior might be a lot more conserved than we think, as we see a lot of similarities between the genes/chromosomes involved in house fly and how this time to initiate mating is controlled in <em>fruit flies</em>.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img style="margin-right: 30px" align="left" src=../images/network.png height="240" width="270">
We're still working on this, but one thing we're trying to see is if this III<sup>M</sup> male mating advantage has anything to do with the way they <em>smell</em>. Across all animals, chemical/pheromonal communication often plays an important role in acquiring mates. In insects, a big part of these pheromones are produced on their exterior cuticle, and we call these "cuticular hydrocarbons" (or CHCs). So right now, we're raising male and female house flies at different temperatures and asking if III<sup>M</sup> and Y<sup>M</sup> males differ in the CHCs they produce. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img style="margin-left: 30px" align="right" src=../images/4meC29.png height="200" width="370">
Our preliminary data seem to suggest there are at least a few CHCs that are being solely produced by one male genotype but not the other. So the next step will be to see if these candidate CHCs actually <em>do</em> anything from a mating standpoint. How do we do that? Well, one way we'll do this is by "perfuming" males that lack a certain CHC and ask if that gives the male an edge when it comes to mating (or if it's a crutch)!
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Through this research, we'll get a better understanding of not just the way sexual interactions work in this house fly system, but it'll also give us a better idea of what the behavioral consequences of sex chromosome evolution are! 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1> <em>The Tug of War</em> between Chemical Communication and Desiccation Tolerance</h1>

Interesting thing about CHCs in insects: even though these CHCs play an important role in communication between insects, that's not actually their <em>primary</em> function. Insects primarily have CHCs to help keep water in them. The thing is, not all CHCs are made alike, and what makes a specific CHC good for retaining water is often at odds with how informative that compound is for chemical communication!
<p>&nbsp;</p>
So that leaves a few interesting questions: First of all, do these III<sup>M</sup> and Y<sup>M</sup> male house flies differ in their ability to tolerate dry environments ("desiccation tolerance")? We think they might given where we find these genotypes in nature, and the fact that they seem to differ in CHC profiles. <em>If they do differ in desiccation tolerance</em>, then the question becomes whether any of the candidate CHCs we identified plays an important role in explaining this difference. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
We think this could set the house fly system to be a <em>really</em> cool system for studying the way natural selection (desiccation tolerance) and sexual selection (pheromone production) often butt heads when it comes to a single trait (CHC profile). Add the unique sex determination system that is <em>M. domestica</em>, and we've got this cool way to see how sex chromosome evolution affects this tug of war between selection pressures.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1> Thermal Physiology/Behavior</h1>

<img style="margin-right: 30px" align="left" src=../images/tolerance.png height="340" width="170">

One way we've shown these III<sup>M</sup> and Y<sup>M</sup> male house flies to differ is in traits related to handling hot and cold temperatures. Since we know that we can predict which type of male we're likely to find in nature according to environmental temperature (Hamm et al. 2005), we set out to test whether these males differ in a battery of thermal-related traits (heat tolerance, cold tolerance, thermal preference).
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Turns out, they <em>do</em> differ in all three of these traits, <em>but</em> these differences only appear when the flies are raised under the right scenarios: Specifically, III<sup>M</sup> males, which are usually found in warmer, low-latitude environments, can tolerate the heat better than Y<sup>M</sup> males, but <em>only</em> when they're consistently developing in that hot environment. The same goes for Y<sup>M</sup> males and tolerating the cold.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
So it looks like there's a real effect of male sex chromosome genotype on thermal physiology, but it only shows itself in the right environmental conditions (a genotype-by-environment, or GxE, interaction).
<p>&nbsp;</p>
But these heat and cold tolerance traits really only tell us how well these flies can handle a situation that they're forced to endure. Thing is, flies can fly... So do these flies differ in <em>where</em> they like to fly? Turns out, that answer is yes, too! But it <em>also</em> depends on the temperature they're raised at. If you raise III<sup>M</sup> or Y<sup>M</sup> males in a too hot or too cold environment, then they just seek temperatures that compensate for that overheating or over-chilling. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img style="margin-left: 30px" align="right" src=../images/preference.png height="250" width="250">
<em>Buuuut</em>, if you raise them at a comfortable, intermediate temperature, then sure enough III<sup>M</sup> males will choose to fly towards warmer temperatures, while Y<sup>M</sup> males like it just a tad cooler, just like we'd expect given where we find these males in nature.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img style="margin-right: 30px" align="left" src=../images/breadth.png height="340" width="170">
So where do we go from here? Well, it's a complicated story, but through all these trials we conducted, the whole time we were also testing thermal traits of females from these same strains, and it turns out they're behaving in ways that we can't explain, but these differences in behavior, along with how we know III<sup>M</sup> and Y<sup>M</sup> males behave, sets up the possibility for <em>sexual</em> selection to act on this system in interesting ways. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
So I'm going to keep following this train of thought to see how a strong, naturally selected trait that is thermal physiology/behavior can have important implications on who mates with whom!
