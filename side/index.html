<h1>Behaviors of the Wild</h1>
I'm currently working on a computer-based and mobile-friendly role-playing game (RPG) focused on animal behavior. The ultimate goal is to create a game that can serve either as a stand-alone or supplement to any animal behavior course. Each level is treated as a chapter, with topics ranging from the genetic, neuronal, and physiological bases of behavior, to specific behavioral topics such as migration, game theory, and mate choice. Each level contains hidden side quests that allow you to learn more about case studies, learn to develop hypotheses, etc. When used as a course supplement, these side quests give the student access to test questions, or items that they can redeem in class (excused absence, "XP boost" -i.e. bonus points- on a written assignment, etc.). If you're interested in test-playing the game, email me at delclosp@uhd.edu for passcodes needed to play!
