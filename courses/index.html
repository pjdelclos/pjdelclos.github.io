<h1> Fall 22 Courses </h1>

- <strong>BIOL 4340: Animal Behavior</strong> - The overall goal of this class is to understand the mechanisms and evolution of animal behavior. Topics include: history of the scientific study of behavior, tools and approaches used to study behavior, the neural, hormonal, developmental, and genetic mechanisms that influence behavior, and ways in which animals survive, obtain resources, and reproduce. The scientific process of theory, hypothesis and experimentation are a critical part of the course.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
- <strong>BIOL 4311: Senior Seminar (Mate Choice and its Consequences)</strong> - The overall goal of this seminar course is to learn to read and critique recent articles related to mate choice, sexual selection, and behavioral genetics. This course follows the typical structure of a journal club, which comprises a significant portion of academic life in graduate school across multiple disciplines.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
- <strong>BIOL 1102: General Biology (Lab)</strong> - Appropriate exercises and experiments requiring scientific observation and analysis that illustrate some of the basic techniques, concepts, and facts presented in BIOL 1302.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
- <strong>BIOL 1302: General Biology (Lecture)</strong> - A survey of current biological concepts for students majoring in the sciences. Emphasis will be placed on topics which include evolution, biological diversity, ecology and comparative structure and function of organ systems.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
- <strong>BIOL 3300: Undergraduate Research</strong> - I'm always interested in taking on undergraduate students to either help me in my own behavioral/genetic research (mostly with house flies) or to help in conducting behavioral/genetic research that interests you! If you're interested in gaining behavioral research experience for credit, send me an email at <a href = "mailto: delclosp@uhd.edu">delclosp@uhd.edu</a>!

<h1>Behaviors of the Wild</h1>
I'm currently working on a computer-based and mobile-friendly role-playing game (RPG) focused on animal behavior. The ultimate goal is to create a game that can serve either as a stand-alone or supplement to any animal behavior course. Each level is treated as a chapter, with topics ranging from the genetic, neuronal, and physiological bases of behavior, to specific behavioral topics such as migration, game theory, and mate choice. Each level contains hidden side quests that allow you to learn more about case studies, learn to develop hypotheses, etc. When used as a course supplement, these side quests give the student access to test questions, or items that they can redeem in class (excused absence, "XP boost" -i.e. bonus points- on a written assignment, etc.). <strong>If you're interested in test-playing the game, email me at <a href = "mailto: delclosp@uhd.edu">delclosp@uhd.edu</a> for the password needed to play!</strong> It still has more than a few bugs, but it should more or less work on your phone or computer.
