<h1> Fall 22 Courses </h1>

- <strong>BIOL 4340: Animal Behavior</strong> - The overall goal of this class is to understand the mechanisms and evolution of animal behavior. Topics include: history of the scientific study of behavior, tools and approaches used to study behavior, the neural, hormonal, developmental, and genetic mechanisms that influence behavior, and ways in which animals survive, obtain resources, and reproduce. The scientific process of theory, hypothesis and experimentation are a critical part of the course.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
- <strong>BIOL 4311: Senior Seminar (Mate Choice and its Consequences)</strong> - The overall goal of this seminar course is to learn to read and critique recent articles related to mate choice, sexual selection, and behavioral genetics. This course follows the typical structure of a journal club, which comprises a significant portion of academic life in graduate school across multiple disciplines.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
- <strong>BIOL 1102: General Biology (Lab)</strong> - Appropriate exercises and experiments requiring scientific observation and analysis that illustrate some of the basic techniques, concepts, and facts presented in BIOL 1302.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
- <strong>BIOL 1302: General Biology (Lecture)</strong> - A survey of current biological concepts for students majoring in the sciences. Emphasis will be placed on topics which include evolution, biological diversity, ecology and comparative structure and function of organ systems.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
- <strong>BIOL 3300: Undergraduate Research</strong> - I'm always interested in taking on undergraduate students to either help me in my own behavioral/genetic research (mostly with house flies) or to help in conducting behavioral/genetic research that interests you! If you're interested in gaining behavioral research experience for credit, send me an email at delclosp@uhd.edu!
